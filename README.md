# Secret Santa Generator

## Overview
The **Secret Santa Generator** is a Python-based application designed to create Secret Santa matches while adhering to specific constraints, such as category and family exclusions. It ensures a user-friendly experience with validation, debugging, and retry mechanisms.

## Features
- **Validation**: Ensures all participants meet the input criteria.
- **Constraints**: Matches are created within the same category, avoiding family matches.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Re-runs the matching process if constraints are not satisfied.
- **User Confirmation**: Displays matches for approval before saving to a file.
- **Debugging**: Comprehensive logs for every execution in a single debug file.
- **Directory Management**: Organizes input, debug, and output files into respective folders.
- **File Handling**: Automatically moves input files to the correct folder and generates organized output files.
